# WWF-No-Mercy-MOD
WWF No Mercy MOD I made inspired by WBNS 97.1 The Fan, OSU Football, and Pop Culture. The following are steps on how to download the emulator, then find the ROM, and lastly install the graphics MOD and save file.

1 - You need to download the Emulator (The virtual N64). I have exclusively used Project64. I am unsure if the graphics patch will work on other emulators. As of 4/2025, they are currently on version 3.0.1. The download link can be found here https://www.pj64-emu.com/public-releases

2 - You need to download the ROM (The game). I have tested this on WWF No Mercy 1.0 and 1.1 (Rev 1), and the patch worked on both. All versions I tested were the English/USA version. I am unsure if this will work on any non English/Non USA versions. Hint: if you google "Vimms Vault" you may be able to find the website that has what you're looking for in "The vault".

3 - Now you need to install Project64. Make sure to remember where you install this at since it will come in handy when placing the MOD/Patch files.

4 - Once Project64 is installed, try to open the game to test to see if it runs. I suggest you mess around with the graphic settings and controller settings to get everything setup before installing the patch. Once setup, close the ROM.

5 - Now you'll want to download the "WWF No Mercy Graphic MOD" from my files.

6 - Next you will want to open up the folder where you installed Project64, and then you should see a folder that says, "SAVE". Open that and you should see a folder that has "WWF No Mercy" in it. Open that up, then open up my RAR/ZIP file "WWF No Mercy Graphic MOD", and open up the "SAVE FILES" folder. Copy the files in there, and replace them with the existing files in the "WWF No Mercy" folder in the Project64 "SAVE" folder.

7 - Next you will want to open up the folder where you installed Project64, and then you should see a folder that says, "TEXTURES". Open that up. It should be empty. Now go to the RAR/ZIP file "WWF No Mercy Graphi MOD", and open up the "GRAPHICS FILE" folder. Copy the file there, and place it into the "TEXTURES" folder.

8 - Next, in Project64, go to the Options --> Graphic Settings --> Texture Enhancement (Tab) --> From here you should see a check box that says, "Use Texture Pack". Check that box. You then should see 3 file paths to input, "Texture Pack Path", "Texture Cache Path", and "Texture Dump Path". For "texture Pack Path", you should make that be the "TEXTURES" folder where you placed file from the "GRAPHICS FILE" folder. The "Taxture Cache Path" and "Texture Dump Path" can be anything of your choosing but make sure it's not the same folder you set as the "Texture Pack Path".

9 - Assuming everything was done correctly, you should be able to startup the game and it should now work.

10 - I have uploaded a youtube video going over this process, so if you had issues following these instructions, refer to the video as backup.

11 - Enjoy!
