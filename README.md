# WWF-No-Mercy-MOD
WWF No Mercy MOD I made inspired by WBNS 97.1 The Fan, OSU Football, and Pop Culture. The following are steps on how to download the emulator, then find the ROM, and lastly install the graphics MOD and save file.

1 - You need to download the Emulator (The virtual N64). I have exclusively used Project64. I am unsure if the graphics patch will work on other emulators. As of 4/2025, they are currently on version 3.0.1. The download link can be found here https://www.pj64-emu.com/public-releases

2 - You need to download the ROM (The game). I have tested this on WWF No Mercy 1.0 and 1.1 (Rev 1), and the patch worked on both. All versions I tested were the English/USA version. I am unsure if this will work on any non English/Non USA versions. Hint: if you google "Vimms Vault" you may be able to find the website that has what you're looking for in "The vault".

3 - Now you need to install Project64. Make sure to remember where you install this at since it will come in handy when placing the MOD/Patch files.

4 - Now you'll want to download the "WWF MOD - Public Master V1.0" from my files.

5 - Once Project64 is installed, open Project64, go to the Options --> Graphic Settings --> Texture Enhancement (Tab) --> From here you should see a check box that says, "Use Texture Pack". Check that box. You then should see 3 file paths to input, "Texture Pack Path", "Texture Cache Path", and "Texture Dump Path", keeps these as their defaults but make note of where they are. Then you should see a textbox talking about transparencies, make sure that is checked. Lastly, check the boch that says to use file cache "instead of system memory"

6 - Next you will want to open up the folder where you installed Project64, and then you should see a folder that says, "Plugin". Open that up. Next open up the "GFX" folder. Next open up the ""GlideN64" folder. Lastly, open up the "cache folder". It should be empty. Now go to the RAR/ZIP file "WWF MOD - Public Master V1.0", and open up the "Project64 - Plugin - GFX - GLideN64 - Cache" folder. Copy the file there, and place it into the "cache" folder.

7 - Now open up the WWF No Mercy Game, and wait until you see an intro screen. Once you do, exit the program in full.

8 - Next you will want to open up the folder where you installed Project64, and then you should see a folder that says, "SAVE". Open that and you should see a folder that has "WWF No Mercy" in it. Open that up, then open up my RAR/ZIP file "WWF MOD - Public Master V1.0", and open up the "Project64 - Save" folder. Copy the files in there, and replace them with the existing files in the "WWF No Mercy" folder in the Project64 "SAVE" folder.

9 - Now, open up Project64 again and try to open the game to test to see if it runs still.

10 - Assuming everything was done correctly, you should be able to startup the game and it should now work. You will know if it worked if the opening text is yellow with a black background, and when you go to characters, Mike Ricordati is the first characters.

11 - I suggest you mess around with the graphic settings and controller settings to get everything setup before trying to play. The game can be finnecky at times, but with the correct graphic settings, it should run real smooth.

12 - I have uploaded a youtube video going over this process, so if you had issues following these instructions, refer to the video as backup.

13 - Enjoy!
